I have replicated all the main tables using Python. The replication package can be found [here.](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/113769/version/V1/view) 
The data folder contains all the dta. files used in the analysis. They comprise three rounds of National Sample Survey data for different sample categories.
